# AWS

Amazon Web Services **(AWS)** is Amazonâ€™s cloud web hosting platform that offers flexible, reliable, scalable, easy-to-use, and cost-effective solutions.
It uses ***pay as you go model***, which means the user has to pay only for those services that he uses. And the bill is calculated only for the time when the services are running or active. There are a lot of services available on AWS some of which are discussed below.

### 1. **EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**
It is a web service interface that provides resizable compute capacity in the AWS cloud. It is designed for developers to have complete control over web-scaling and computing resources.

EC2 instances can be resized and the number of instances scaled up or down as per our requirement. These instances can be launched in one or more geographical locations or regions, and **Availability Zones (AZs)**. Each region comprises of several AZs at distinct locations, connected by low latency networks in the same region.
